This repository contains my solutions and progress for the Advent of Code 2024 challenges in C++. Each day's solution is organized in its 
own cpp file, making it easy to navigate.

*Each day's solution has its own directory(**day01**, **day02**, etc.) 
with seperate files for each part*

## Running the Solutions

To run a specific day's solution, execute the relative cpp file within 
your IDE (no exe).

If you want to view or alter any of the input for a puzzle, each day's
directory has it's own PuzzleInputs file (see project structure).

## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding 
challenge that takes place in December. It consists of daily programming 
puzzles that can be solved using any programming language.

## Contributing

If you have any input or a better solution to any of the puzzles 
feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request!
